#Pokeemon-Adventure-Bot

This bot was made to allow discord users to enjoy the world of Pok√©mon in their channels. The obvious question is "Why not just play the actual games?", and a good question that would be.
The thought process behind it was basically that it would be a fun project that I could stretch my node skills and something I could show off to my friends and that they could interact with.

The bot utilizes the Discord.js library, which is built with OOP in mind which was a nice change of pace from usual JS-based applications.

The db used here is MongoDB with the mongoose library, I like the simplicity of MongoDB when I need to stand a database up quickly and make test queries to confirm my applications are functioning properly.

The bot is not currently finished, but due to that thing we call life I have other projects that are taking precedence. I hope to return to this project soon and "finish" it to a useable point.
